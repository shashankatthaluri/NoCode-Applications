## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.11 or higher) 🐍
- Flask (version 3.0 or higher) 🌐
- Google Cloud SDK (for Translate API) ☁️
- OpenAI API Key 🔑

### Installation
Clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashankatthaluri/NoCode-Applications/new/main/Code-Explainer.git
cd Code-Explainer
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup

- Set up your Google Cloud project and enable the Translation API.
- Obtain your OpenAI API key and replace it in the app.py file.
- Configure environment variables for sensitive information (optional but recommended).

### Obtaining API Keys and Project IDs
#### OpenAI API Key
To use the OpenAI API for generating code explanations and comments, you need an API key. Follow these steps to obtain your OpenAI API key:

1. Visit the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to your account settings or dashboard to find your API key.
3. Copy the API key and securely store it.

#### Google Cloud Translate Project ID and API Key
For translating code explanations into multiple languages, you'll need both a Google Cloud project ID and an API key. Here’s how to set them up:

1. Create a new project or select an existing project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable the Google Cloud Translate API for your project.
3. Navigate to the API & Services > Credentials section in the Cloud Console.
4. Create new credentials and select API key to generate your Google Cloud API key.
5. Copy the API key and securely store it.
6. Locate your Google Cloud project ID from the Cloud Console dashboard.

### Configuration
After obtaining your API keys and project ID, configure them in your project:

- Replace the placeholder API keys in the `app.py` file with your actual keys.
- Set up environment variables for sensitive information, including API keys, to enhance security (recommended).


## Features
### Code Explanation
The application uses OpenAI's language models to generate simple English explanations for provided code snippets.

### Adding Comments
Users can dynamically add or remove comments to code snippets using AI-generated prompts and responses.

### Language Translation
Utilizes Google Cloud's Translation API to translate code explanations from English into multiple languages.

### User Feedback
Allows users to provide feedback through a comprehensive rating system, comments, and emoji reactions.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: Web framework for backend development and serving HTML templates.🌐
- Google Cloud Translate API: Provides language translation features within the application.☁️
- OpenAI API: Powers code explanation and comment generation features for enhanced code comprehension. 🔑
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend components developed using standard web technologies for an intuitive user interface.🖥️
